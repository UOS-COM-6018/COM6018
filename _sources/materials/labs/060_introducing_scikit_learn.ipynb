    "In this lab class, we will use the scikit-learn library to implement a k-nearest neighbour classifier and apply it to a simple classification problem. Before attempting this lab, make sure that you have read the corresponding tutorial notes [060_Introducing_Scikit_Learn](https://uos-com-6018.github.io/COM6018/materials/tutorials/060_Introducing_Scikit_Learn.html).\n",

    "The classification task that we will tackle in this lab concerns the passive detection of land mines. The data set is described in the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/763/land+mines-1) and in the following publication,\n",
    "\n",
    "- Yilmaz, C., Kahraman, H. T., & SÃ¶yler, S. (2018). *Passive mine detection and classification method based on hybrid model*. IEEE Access, 6, 47870-47888 [DOI:10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2866538](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/763/land+mines-1).\n",
    "\n",
    "Landmines can be detected using a passive sensor similar to a metal detector. The detector is swept above the ground and produces a voltage signal output. If the value is high, then that indicates that there is possibly a mine present. This mine can then be carefully cleared. The problem is that there are other things that can cause a signal. Furthermore, the strength of the signal depends on the level of the sensor above the ground and the type of soil.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data is provide for 338 detections some of which are landmines and some of which are not. For each sample, the following three measurements are provided:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Voltage (V): The output voltage value from a magnetic sensor.\n",
    "- High (H): The height of the sensor above the ground.\n",
    "- Soil Type (S): A value that corresponds to the amount of moisture in the soil.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output label that we wish to predict is one of 5 classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1: No Landmine \n",
    "- 2: Anti-Tank Mine\n",
    "- 3: Anti-Personnel Mine\n",
    "- 4: Booby-trapped Anti-Tank Mine\n",
    "- 5: M14 Anti-Personnel Mine\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a roughly equal number of samples for each class. \n",
    "\n",
    "The primary task is to distinguish between class 1 (i.e., no mine) and the other classes (i.e., some type of mine). This is a binary classification problem, i.e., a `detection` problem. But we will consider the multi-class problem of distinguishing between all 5 classes. If the detector could tell us which type of mine is likely to be present, this would be useful information for the team that has to clear the mine.\n"

Our approach to tuning was rather ad hoc and relied on cutting-and-pasting code. This can easily lead to the introduction of mistakes. Things get even trickier when we use more sophisticated classifiers with a greater number of hyperparameters. Luckily, Scikit-Learn provides a lot of tools to help us deal with this problem. Next week and in the next lab class, we will use these tools to develop a more systematic approach to tuning hyperparameters."
