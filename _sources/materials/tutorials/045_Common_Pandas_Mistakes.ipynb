    "The 'SettingWithCopyWarning' is one of the most commonly encountered problems for new users of Pandas. You will find many people asking about it online. As it is a warning, it is easy to ignore. However, it is important to understand what it means and how to fix your code when you see it because it means that you are doing something that is not guaranteed to work.\n",

A copy is a new DataFrame that contains a completely new copy of the original data (or some part of it). A view is a new DataFrame that contains a reference to the original data (or some part of it).
